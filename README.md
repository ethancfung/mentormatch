#ASUS Mentorship Program's Automatic Matching

The is program was commissioned by the ASUS Mentorship Program. The goal of this project was to mitigate the manual matching of first years to upper years by having a program do it instead. First years and upper years sign up through a Gooogle Forms and then automatically being paired through the program. This code was based on the Virtual Water Cooler created by Dennis Hyunh.
